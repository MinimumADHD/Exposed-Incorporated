## [Detecting Collisions in 2D environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66906099/how-do-i-detect-collision-in-godot)
- RigidBody2D has physics
- StaticBody2D has no phyisics, yet collisions still apply.

## Player controls
- Simple ui controls can be used using arrows, which is however not suggested
- Attaching a script to a CharacterBody2D automatically generates player controls for it
